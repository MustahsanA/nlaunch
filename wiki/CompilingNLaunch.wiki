The only prerequisite for build NLaunch locally is to download and install [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mbarnett/ilmerge.aspx ILMerge].
If you install it in the default path (C:\Program Files\Microsoft\ILMerge) then you are done, if you install it anywhere else you need to tell this fact to the build script: copy the file `local.properties.xml.template` to `local.properties.xml` and edit its contents accordingly.

To build NLaunch locally you just need to run `build.bat`.

To open the Visual Studio solution you will need to build the project through the build script at least once in order for it to generate the AssemblyInfo.cs that is referenced by the NLaunch project.
