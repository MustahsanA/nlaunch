The configuration file must have the same file name as the NLaunch executable but with XML extension (yourapp.nlaunch.exe & yourapp.nlaunch.xml)

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<nlaunch>
  <protocol>ftp</protocol>                                           (1)
  <updatesLocation>ftp://user:password@server.com/</updatesLocation> (2)
  <applicationExe>Test.App.exe</applicationExe>                      (3)
</nlaunch>
}}}
